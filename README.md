# MySchedule

## Description

This is a scheduling app, that allows users to view their schedules and enlist in courses.
In addition to standard users, there are also admin users, who can create events.
Assistants can wish for a specific event to be created.

## How does it work?

Upon starting the app, you will be either asked to create an account or log in. Note that you can only create an Assistant or Student.

After logging in, you can view your schedule, and if you are a student, you can also enlist in courses. As an assistant you are given the option to "make a wish"

Admins can view current wishes and create an event if they want to.

## How to run it?

This app is made for a MYSQL database, so you will need to have that installed. You will also need to have a server running on your machine.
Note that you need to have the correct database-schema or the app will not work. You can find the schema in the file "database-schema.sql"
